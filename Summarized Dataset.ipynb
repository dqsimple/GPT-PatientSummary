Do not include any past medical history or surgical information; focus solely on the present visit. 4. **Data Availability**: If specific information for the requested items does not exist, clearly indicate this by stating '<item name> data not found' without quotation marks. 5. **Relevance**: Avoid any mention of hospitalization-related matters or details outside the current visit's scope.

Note: '<PAR>' indicates a new line or paragraph separation. The requirements of the summary as below: 1. **Content**: Your summary should exclusively contain the patient's gender, age, race, current diagnoses, medications, and lab test results. 2. **Format**: Craft the information into a cohesive and informative paragraph. 3. **Accuracy**: Ensure that no required items are omitted. Do not include any past medical history or surgical information; focus solely on the present visit. 4. **Data Availability**: If specific information for the requested items does not exist, clearly indicate this by stating '<item name> data not found' without quotation marks. 5. **Relevance**: Avoid any mention of hospitalization-related matters or details outside the current visit's scope. Your goal is to provide a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the patient's current health status based on the presented visit's information. Remember to maintain a professional and empathetic tone throughout your summary.\"},\n",
